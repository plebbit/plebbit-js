    "tagline": "Plebbit is a serverless, adminless, decentralized social media protocol built on IPFS, Gossipsub, and blockchain naming systems (ENS, SNS). It doesn't use any central server, central database, public HTTP endpoint or DNS, it is pure peer to peer. Plebbit is completely free to run, and there's no need to have a DNS/TLS to host your own instance",
    "description": "Plebbit is a true peer-to-peer social media platform that eliminates the need for central servers, admins, or traditional hosting infrastructure. Communities exist as IPNS records on the IPFS network, while gossipsub handles real-time propagation of posts, comments, votes, and moderation actions. The platform achieves full P2P functionality across web and mobile platforms using Helia and libp2p, ensuring users can participate directly in the network without relying on centralized gateways. Users can create and moderate their own communities with custom verification challenges - from simple captchas to requiring specific NFTs or token balances. The protocol supports multiple client interfaces (Reddit-like, imageboard, forum-style) that are all interoperable on the same underlying network. With features like gasless governance, P2P direct messaging, and EVM token tipping, Plebbit provides a censorship-resistant social experience where community owners have full control and users maintain their data sovereignty.
