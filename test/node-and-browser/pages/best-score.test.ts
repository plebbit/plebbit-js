// `best` is the Wilson lower bound of the vote ratio. The scorer adds Reddit's implicit first upvote to the
// upvotes but used to leave it out of the total, so p = (up + 1) / (up + down) exceeded 1 whenever a comment had
// upvotes and no downvotes and the square root went NaN. Page generation tolerated the NaN as an arbitrary order
// until the strict numeric check of configurable sorts (issue #73) made the community skip the whole `best` sort
// of any post with such a reply, which is how the createcomment depth-1 test lost its preloaded replies page.
