-   You don't need to run build if you're modifying files outside src/
-   Make sure to run npm run build if you're modifying files inside src/, and make sure it passes with no errors
-   each http router keep provider announcement for only 24 hours
-   If you're gonna edit schema make sure to check for docs relevant to the local zod version by checking package.json
-   Run every automated test suite through `node test/run-test-config.js --plebbit-config ${plebbit-config} ${testPath}` so our Vitest setup enforces bail/allowOnly/timeouts automatically. you need to supply test path to run-test-config.js. You also need to choose plebbit-config. If the test is inside test/node then choose "local-kubo-rpc"
-   When running RPC tests (e.g. remove.test.js), set `USE_RPC=1` in the environment
-   You should never use removeAllListeners because it removes error listener initialized in constructor which may cause process to crash
-   If you need to troubleshoot or debug anything related to a local subplebbit, you can run sqlite queries against its database at `${plebbitDataPath}/subplebbits/${subplebbitAddress}`
-   You can't add code that only works in node under src/, it has to be under src/runtime/node, or otherwise it will fail browser build
-   Do not include this.timeout in tests, that is not supported by vitest
-   When I report a bug or regression to you we need to figure out how to reproduce it determinstically in a test case first and then we can brainstorm how to fix it.
-   Test files should be written in TypeScript (.test.ts). The test runner will type-check all TypeScript test files before running them.
-   When modifying files under test/, run `npx tsc --project test/tsconfig.json --noEmit` to verify types are correct.
-   If you need to mock consider to use vitest utilities for mocking
-   If you're gonna mock a comment, you need to create a fixture that's similar to how it looks to production like this one. For comment (CommentIpfs), look at test/fixtures/signatures/comment/commentUpdate/valid_comment_ipfs.json, while for commentUpdate look at test/fixtures/signatures/comment/commentUpdate/valid_comment_update.json
-   Keep in mind that a comment's bytes size during publication is limited to 40kb
-   When writing new functions, prefer a single object parameter with all args (e.g., `signComment({ comment, plebbit })` instead of `signComment(comment, plebbit)`)
-   When you're debugging a failure or a test failure in CI, you should check `test_server.log` for subplebbit logs and `test_node_${config}.stdout.log`/`test_node_${config}.stderr.log` artifacts for client logs (where config is e.g. `remote-kubo-rpc`)
-   When I report a bug or test failure, you need to try to understand the root cause instead of trying to fix it with timeouts
-   When you modify a test file you need to make sure it passes test build process of tsc with test/tsconfig.json
- Do not commit /dist to git
